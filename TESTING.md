Manual testing was carried out as soon as the project started using exploratory testing techniques and a list of bugs was identified and placed in a table to tackle.
At the same time as building the web, it was tested before moving to another steps and checking no major issues were found.
Afterwards, formal test cases were developed and executed.
Automated testing was carried out at a later stage using validators and all errors were fixed, it was checked that all user goals are met and after this, a test case table was created.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### Python Linter

I used [Python Linter - Pep8CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to test python code, most errors were fixed which were related to spacing or lines length.

![Python Linter](docs/testing/python-linter/python_linter.jpg)

Some long line errors remained due to the impossibility of splitting up lines of code that would stop working otherwise or in build django code for example some lines at setting.py

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
